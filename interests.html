                    Minecraft is one of my favorite games because I have a server
                    that I love to play on because of the community that's on it.
                    I've built a nice base and I've made some great friends. I like
                     playing the Sims 4 because I can decorate houses and sometimes I
                    end up making a story to go with the house I'm decorating. In Stardew
                    Valley I like to wander the town and make an efficient farm layout.

                    I haven't read as much here as I thought I was going to, but I read a lot
                    durning middle and high school. The Stranje House is a series that I love.
                    It's about 5 girls becoming spies for England (or France, its been awhile
                    since I've read them), and they're trying to stop Napoleon. Each girl was 
                    casted from their family to get "fixed" because they weren't "normal".
