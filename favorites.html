                <p>
                    I use spotify a lot since I listen to music while I work on
                    things or when I go to school. Listening to music helps me 
                    focus since I can easily block other things out and since I 
                    listen to the same playlist, I can also block out the music.
                    Shinedown is the main band I listen to. I grew up listening to 
                    them and some other older rock bands. I've been to a few Shinedown 
                    concerts, but that's all. I have a hard time expanding my music 
                    because of some of my family, so I just stick to what I grew up on.

                    W3Schools helped me through out high school. My web teacher was learning 
                    with us so she didn't  know a whole lot about what she was teaching, but 
                    I always enjoyed showing her new things that I found and figured out how 
                    they worked. I loved that class and I'm sure that she's the reason that 
                    I enjoy making websites.
