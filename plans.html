                <q>None of us are just black or white, or never wrong and always right. No one. No one exists without polarities. 
                    Everybody has good and bad forces working with them, against them, and within them.

                    Something I plan to do is get a job that I enjoy, have a horse farm, and live with my S/O (if I have one at the time). 
                    With this college I plan to go into a job that I'll enjoy and hopefully after some years work from home or have my own little 
                    business. Since I grew up with horses, I want to continue owning them, plus riding horses is something I love to do. I want to 
                    live with my S/O because I want to be around the people that I love, plus I'll be able to teach them about horses, if they don't 
                    know already.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What's going to be most important to me is that I end up doing something I love and I won't regret my choices or my life.
                    I want to have horses and that will never change about my future plans and it's not something I'm willing to easily let go 
                    of having. I know that I won't be able to have horses right out of college, but as soon as I can I'm going to have my farm.
